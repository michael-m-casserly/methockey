<br>
<div align="center" class="PageHeader">Team Rules</div>
<br/>
<strong>A. GAME PROCEDURES</strong><br><br>
<b>1.</b> MINIMUM PLAYERS NEEDED: For a game to start, each team needs a minimum of 5 players and 1 goaltender. No skater will be allowed to participate with figure skates or goaltender skates. In the event that a team does not have a sufficient number of players, that team will forfeit the game. The governing board may review the teams' situation.<br><br>
<b>2.</b> MAXIMUM PLAYERS SUITED: Each Team may dress Players not exceeding the following: 1) Maximum of 19 Skaters (3 Goalies)<br><br>
<b>3a.</b> GRACE TIME FOR LATE TEAMS WITH EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES: A thirty minute grace period will be given to a team to be on the ice when they are late to a game. The team is expected to contact the rink and the opposing team, if possible, explaining the extenuating circumstance.<br><br>
<b>3b.</b> BAD WEATHER CONDITIONS/SNOW: Below is our protocol. <strong>For those teams who may rely on school transportation, I would put the wheels in motion now</strong> to try and make other arrangements if school transportation is not available as the games will affect the final playoff seeding and we have a very short window to reschedule the game. Please use this entire email distribution list if there are any issues (i.e. Game cancellations) so we can inform the officials, the official assignors. If issues should arise regarding your games, please contact your assignor immediately (see below). Additionally all contact phone numbers and emails are listed on the MCHC website on each team's individual page. If games are cancelled because of the snow, obviously it would be best to try and reschedule it as soon as possible. However in cases where it just cannot be done, at some point in time the MCHC Executive Board will rule on cases which effect seeding for playoffs. Officials: Gerry Donnelly: <a href="mailto:GERARD103@AOL.COM" target="_blank">GERARD103@AOL.COM</a> (516) 885-4432.<br><br>
                    
The following are steps to consider when making decisions about a game scheduled for a rink with anticipated inclement weather:<br><br>
a) The first step is to keep lines of communication open between the teams (coaches) and the referee assignor and not panic based upon media hype of the forecasts. Follow the forecasts for your area and the rink area, and contact the opposing coach prior to traveling. If you can travel to a rink and have reasonable reports that the trip back will be safe, then continue with the  schedule. Base decisions upon actual conditions and factual reports. Television and radio stations only report the &quot;worst conditions&quot; for their major  market and hype reports to &quot;sell airtime&quot;. They don't have to deal with the problems when the &quot;worst conditions&quot; don't happen.<br><br>
b) Use your best judgment for travel, especially if you are using students to drive school vans. No one wants an accident due to a young driver's mistake during bad weather. Accidents due to student drivers of school vans have happened before with ice hockey club teams in the ACHA. Remember, its not just  getting to the rink but having the students drive back after playing a game. The weather conditions at the end of a game can be significantly different than when it started and you must consider that student drivers are tired after a game. Also, professional drivers of coach buses will know how to handle the conditions and have alternate routes. The length of the trip might increase due to traffic conditions but the trip will be safe and a late game start is much better than no game at all!<br><br>
c) Check to see if your institution or the opponent's institution has cancelled classes and verify if this affects off-campus events or the ability to use  schools vans. If an institution declares a closing, then contact your school administrator and the opposing coach to see if the game may continue. Schools cancel classes due to accumulations in parking lots and not based upon the road conditions to rinks.<br><br>
d) If any of the areas (town or county) you are traveling to, have declared a &quot;weather emergency&quot;, then this is a justifiable reason for canceling a game. A declaration of an &quot;Emergency&quot; for any situation limits travel by the residents of the area on local roads but rarely includes interstates.<br><br>
e) Verify that the rink is operating even though a rink closing is a rare  event. Don't assume the rink will be running a late schedule due to bad weather. Most rinks operate in most conditions as Ice Hockey is a WINTER sport and thus is subject to winter weather conditions.<br><br>
f) Prior to &quot;pulling the trigger&quot; and cancelling a game, consider the impact for your team and the opposition. If travel to a game can be safely accomplished by the minimum number of players, then keep the schedule. The league's standings are tight and teams should earn their points to make the playoff spots. Making the playoffs or losing a spot in the playoffs due to a forfeit is not part of the competitive spirit.<br><br>
<b>4.</b> TEAM UNIFORMS/EQUIPMENT: All teams' players must have identical jerseys, hose, pants and helmets. Goaltenders may have a different colored helmet/mask but must have an identical jersey. A player out of uniform cannot play. There will be no exceptions. Mouth guards are MANDATORY equipment for ALL players and goalkeepers. (a) No mouthpiece - an officials warning, (b) if continued 10-minute misconduct. Additionally, you cannot alter any equipment from the manufacturer's specifications, so if a helmet was made with J clips &amp; ear flaps, you can't remove them. This is a requirement by the NCAA as well as for insurance purposes. All helmets without these specifications will be considered an &quot;illegal&quot; helmet and will not be able to participate in an MCHC game.<br><br>
<b>5.</b> OFFICIAL SCORER AND TIMEKEEPER: The home team must provide a minimum of one timekeeper and one scorekeeper. The maximum number of persons allowed in the scorer's box will be three (3) staff members from the home team and one (1) member from the visiting team.<br><br>
<b>6.</b> HOME TEAM'S RESPONSIBILITY:<br><br>
a) It is the home team's responsibility to provide a score sheet, penalty sheet, and 10 pucks to the official scorer's table prior to the pre-game warm-up period. Game pucks should be frozen (iced) prior to the game.<br><br>
b) All home teams will provide their opponents with 20 practice pucks for pre-game warm-ups.<br><br>
c) At the conclusion of the game, it is the responsibility of the home team to ensure that the middle copy (yellow) of the score sheet and penalty sheet are given to the visiting team. The white copy of the score sheet remains with the home team, the last copy (pink) can now be discarded. The league no longer requires the home team to send the any copies of the score sheet to the Conference Office.<br><br>
d) The 4 white score sheets (score sheet, penalty sheets and both team rosters) must be sent to the League President via email (PDF), so that the league statistics can be updated on a timely basis. The email must be received by Monday afternoon for all weekend games. The email address is <a href="mailto:fordhamhockey@verizon.net" target="_blank">fordhamhockey@verizon.net</a> or <a href="mailto:fordhamhockey@gmail.com" target="_blank">Fordhamhockey@gmail.com</a>. Failure to email the score sheets will result in fines. See the section entitled payment and fines.<br><br>
e) The home team must submit the game score to the MCHC by use of the MCHC's web page submission form within twenty-four (24) hours of the game. Failure to submit scores will result in fines. See the section entitled payment and fines.<br><br>
f) All home teams must have a trainer present for their home games. No trainer = $100 fine.<br><br>
<b>7.</b> AWAY TEAM'S RESPONSIBILITY:<br><br>
a) For the purpose of getting the most accurate information in rating our officials and as a good check and balance, we ask that the away team submit the score as well and please rate the officials. This can be done with 48 hours of the game. This is not a league requirement, and is completely optional.<br><br>
<b>8.</b> GAME PLAYER ROSTER FORMS: Each team is to complete a game player roster form and provide the official scorekeeper with the form by the beginning of the warm-up period. The visiting team is required to hand in their roster prior to the home team. Each team will be provided with a copy of their opponent's roster.<br><br>
<b>9.</b> A team reserves the right to challenge another team's roster to verify player eligibility. The team challenging the roster shall advise the officials, who will then request identification (i.e., driver's license, official college identification card) from each player on the team. The official will check each player against the submitted game roster. A report will be provided to the MCHC's board of directors for final determination.<br><br>
<b>10.</b> FORFEITURE: In the event that a forfeit is awarded, the governing board shall review for possible further action.<br><br>
<b>11.</b> MERCY RULE: In a game where one team is ahead by ten (10) goals or more and at least 2 full periods have been played, the final period will be played with running time. It is relevant if a team cuts the deficit to less than 10 goals  during the final period of play, the game will still be played with a running clock.<br><br>
<b>12.</b> COACH EJECTED FROM A GAME / PLAYER EJECTED FROM A GAME: If a coach is ejected from a game, an assistant coach must take their place. If there is no assistant coach on the bench, the game will be forfeited by that team. A referee's report is to be filed within five days of the game. The coach must be nowhere near the players bench and must either a) leave the arena or b) sit in the stands. If the stands are behind the team benches, the coach must be in a place nowhere near their team. Use common sense on this. Protocol will be the same as it pertains to a player being ejected from a game, do not be anywhere near your team. Furthermore, the governing board will review each case for possible additional sanctions.<br><br>
<b>13.</b> SHORTAGE OF TIME: If there is not enough time to complete the full twenty (20) minute third period, the following is to occur: (1) eliminate the ice cut, (2) the remaining ice time is to be halved and that will be the third period's length. Coaches have no options on the above.<br><br>
<b>14.</b> GAMES ENDING IN A TIE: In the event that the score is tied at the end of regulation time, a five minute, four-on-four sudden death overtime shall be played. If the game remains tied at the end of the five minute overtime, the teams shall proceed to a three (3) player shoot-out. Each  team shall designate three (3) players, who will participate in a shoot-out.  The visiting team shall begin the shoot-out by attempting to score on a  breakaway. Both teams will alternate until all six players have had an  opportunity to score. If neither team scores, or if the score remains tied, after all six players have had their attempt, the teams shall proceed to a single player, sudden-death shoot-out. No player may shoot twice until all players on the team, with the exception of goaltenders, have shot once. The team with the highest number of goals scored at the end of the sudden death round shall be declared the winner. The score shall be reported with one goal added to the winning team's end of regulation score. [Note that if after regulation time the game is tied, both teams shall be awarded one point for the tie. The team which wins the &quot;overtime shoot-out&quot; will be awarded with a bonus point in the standings.]<br>
<br>
<strong>The ACHA does not follow this rule - their rule is simple - 5 minute overtime - no shoot-out. Please keep this in mind when reporting a score to the ACHA. In their eyes the game is officially over after the 5 minute overtime, even if our rule is different.</strong><br>
<br>
<b>15.</b> PLAYER CONCUSSION RULE: During any game or practice, a Team Official who suspects an Athlete has incurred a concussion, must remove the Athlete from the game or practice and have the Athlete evaluated. The Athlete is not permitted to return to any game or practice until written clearance is received by the Team Official from a Licensed Physician.<br><br>
<br/>

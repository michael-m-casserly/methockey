<div class="PageHeader">MCHC Officially Cancels 2020-21 Season</div>

<p>February 11, 2021 - The membership of the Metropolitan Collegiate Hockey Conference (MCHC) have come to the difficult decision to cancel the league's season due to the current COVID-19 situation.</p>

<p>We have tried to wait as long as we could to render this decision, but it seems time is not on our side.</p>

<p>With the time frame on the spring calendar growing shorter and the inability of most programs under the MCHC umbrella being allowed to play, we have been hindered in our ability to move forward with a season.</p>

<p>Individual member institutions will have the ability to schedule competition based on institutional policy coupled with local and state health guidelines, but they will not be sanctioned MCHC games.</p>

<p>Andrew Mola<br/>
President<br/>
M.C.H.C.</p>

<div class="PageHeader">MCHC Mourns Passing of Jack Vanasco</div>

<p>December 12, 2023 - I am sad to report on the passing of Jack Vanasco.</p> 

<p>If he officiated one of your games, you would surely remember him.</p>
  
<p>I personally forged a relationship with him as he always requested to do our alumni games just to see who would come out that played against him as a member of Wagner or who he officiated as a league referee.</p>
  
<p>Jack was a part of the fabric that is the MCHC.  As both a player for Wagner College and an official for more than 35 years, he had an impact on the game with his presence, his smile, and his larger-than-life personality.</p>
  
<p>Below is the link with arrangements for his wake.</p>

<p>May he rest in peace.</p>
